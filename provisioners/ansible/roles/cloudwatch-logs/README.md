# Role Name

Installs AWS CloudWatch Log Agent

## Requirements

Requires ec2_metadata_facts.

## Role Variables

`logs`, `extra_logs`: list of logs with the following keys:

| Name        | Description                | Required | Default         |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| file        | Full path to log file      | Yes      |
| format      | Datetime format            | No       | None            |
| group_name  | CloudWatch Log Group       | Yes      |
| stream_name | CloudWatch Log Stream Name | No       | The instance id |

`awslogs_loglevel`: maximal log level for the Log Agent's logs itself
("debug", "info", "warning", "error" or "critical"). If this parameter is
not specified, no specific logging configuration will take place and the
default level (info) will be used. This parameter is very basic and does not
allow flexible logging configuration, its only goal is to change the amount
of logs going into the log agent's own logfile.

## Dependencies
